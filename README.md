# FindCandi

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

& yes, I'm using `momentjs` lol

### Platform(s) Supported

This is tested & targeted towards Chrome on MacOS other environments may have a diminished user experience.

### Project Scope

- [x] The application should be built using a modern JS framework (i.e., Angular, React or Vue).
- [x] The app should consist of a single page with a single search bar.
- [x] Results should instantly display on the same page as the search bar as the user searches.
- [x] The search results should include the following attributes of the user:
  - [x] username
  - [x] avatar
  - [x] location
  - [x] real name
  - [x] email
  - [x] count of public repositories
  - [x] account creation timestamp
  - [x] last update timestamp
- [x] Search results should be paginated or limited.
- [x] In appropriate places, users should be able to link out to the user’s profile, repository or other
      destinations that may be helpful to the users of this application.
- [ ] Other features may be suggested or added at your discretion to improve user experience,
      usability or otherwise enhance the application
  - [ ] Ran out of time :(

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
